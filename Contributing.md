- Ensure tests pass before submitting a PR:

  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```

## üìú **Code Style Guide**

- Follow the official [.NET coding conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).
- Use `camelCase` for local variables and parameters.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names, properties, and methods.
- Use `_camelCase` for class fields
- Objects should own their own data, as such, please keep public properties to a minimum and leverage the [visitor pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor) for data contributions in the workflow
