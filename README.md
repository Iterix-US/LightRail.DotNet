**Date extensions that make sense:**

```csharp
var future = DateTime.Now.Plus(years: 1, months: 3);

### Future Features

- Interface wrappers for static classes
  1. Allows for unit testing to be more fluid
  2. Does impose a memory usage overhead, but may be worth the cost to ensure functional stability
- AI-assisted translations
  1. Still thinking about this one.
  2. I'm usually pretty hesitent about implementing AI tooling
  3. Would need to be able to cache/store translations locally or to a local area network device in case of internet outage
